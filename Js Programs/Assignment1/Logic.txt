Logic for pokemonFunctions(js) file:

For first function:
The first for loop traverses the whole dataset till the length of pokemon objects(i.e., 151)
Next, the if condition checks whether the name is there or not
Then, when the name is found, it is  printed using console.


For second function:
The first for loop is to traverse whole dataset for pokemon objects.
In this loop, the if condition checks whether the next_evolution field exists in the pokemon object or not.
If it is there, then there is a second for loop, which is required to traverse in elements of next_evolution.
When the given name matches the name field of next_evolution, it prints the name to console.
In this way, for every match in name, it gets printed.


For third function:
The functioning of this function is as same as above function, except for which in first for loop,
there is aan if condition to check next_evolution. But here, no such condition is required as weakness is there for every pokemon.
The given weakness is matched with weaknesses of pokemons and if they have it, then it gets printed to console.
